Purpose of Project : Discover trending topics(phrase) in large text datasets using embedding and clustering techniques.

Steps to Achieve the Purpose:
1. convert text into embedding.
- in case to reuse embedding and text, save information into mapper

2. load text to process and retrieve embedding from mapper. If embedding is not found, convert text into embedding and save into mapper.

3. process text with embedding
- use umap to reduce dimension of embedding
- use clustering algorithm to cluster embedding(e.g. hdbscan)
- define and extract information of clusters
- with inside of Topic cluser, various sub-topic can be defined by re-clustering inside of cluster if needed
- extract representative phrases for each cluster(by using LLM model, extract keywords from representative text of cluster)

4. analyze more information from clusters
- calculate statistics of clusters
- find relationships between clusters
- track changes of clusters over time(e.g. merge, split, grow, shrink)
- cluster's evolution analysis(e.g. cluster lifespan, stability with fft or other methods)

5. visualize results
- plot clusters in 2D or 3D space
- plot time series data of clusters
- create interactive visualizations if needed
