Purpose of Project : Discover trending topics(phrase) in large text datasets using embedding and clustering techniques.

Current step of Project : Visualize results

Dataset to use:
Cluster_stats is showing base information of cluster.
cluster_stats ->
Dict[Dict[topic(int):
avg_similarity(float),
cohesion(float),
cohesion_std(float),
daily_activity_mean(float),
date_range_days(int),
n_subtopics(int),
size(int),
subtopic_entropy(float),
subtopic_stats(Dict)]]

subtopic_stats ->
Dict[Dict[topic(int):
avg_similarity(float),
size(int)]]

Timeline is showing trendical change of cluster's time series. Drift is data which showing change of centroid from main cluster's centroid.
timeline ->
Dict[Dict[topic(int):
daily_metrics(list)
total_documents(int)
date_range(dict)]]

daily_metrics ->
Dict[Dict[index:
date:str,
count:int,
drift:float,
cohesion:float,
subtopic_0_drift:float,
subtopic_1_drift:float,
...]]

date_range ->
Dict[
start(str),
end(str),
days(int)]

Event is showing trend's regime change such as strong growth, weak shrinkage... etc.
event ->
List[
DataFrame(columns=[ADX,DI+,DI-,Slope,Freq,trend], index=date)]
]

Stability is showing cluster's information about stability.
stability ->
Dict[Dict[topic(int):
count_mean(float),
count_std(float),
coefficient_of_variation(float),
drift_mean(float),
drift_std(float),
stability_score(float),
fft_analysis(dict)]]

fft_analysis ->
Dict[
dominant_frequency(float),
dominant_period_days(float),
power_ratio(float),
is_periodic(bool)]

Purpose of Visualization:
1. Cluster Overview Dashboard: Create an interactive dashboard that summarizes key statistics from cluster_stats, stability, and timeline data. Include visual elements like bar charts for cluster sizes, line graphs for daily activity trends, and heatmaps for cohesion metrics.
2. Trend Analysis Graphs: Develop detailed line graphs to visualize daily_metrics for selected clusters, highlighting trends, drifts, and subtopic dynamics over time.
3. Event Highlighting: Integrate event data into the trend analysis graphs to mark significant regime changes, using annotations or shaded areas to indicate periods of strong growth or shrinkage.
4. Stability Visualization: Create visual representations of stability metrics, such as scatter plots or radar charts, to illustrate the relationship between stability scores and other factors like drift and count variability.
5. Interactive Features: Implement interactive features such as tooltips, zooming, and filtering options to allow users to explore the data in depth and focus on specific clusters or time periods.
6. Summary Reports: Generate automated summary reports that provide insights into the most significant trends and patterns identified in the dataset, supported by the visualizations created.
