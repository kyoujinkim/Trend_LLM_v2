Purpose of Project : Discover trending topics(phrase) in large text datasets using embedding and clustering techniques.

Steps to Achieve the Purpose:
1. convert text into embedding.
- in case to reuse embedding and text, save information into mapper

2. load text to process and retrieve embedding from mapper if exists

3. process text with embedding
- use umap to reduce dimension of embedding
- use clustering algorithm to cluster embedding(e.g. hdbscan)
- define and extract information of clusters
- add more branch of the cluster if needed

4. save processed information into output file
- save cluster information
- save any additional information needed for further analysis
- save time series data of cluster such as frequency over time if applicable, or size of cluster over time

5. analyze more information from clusters
- calculate statistics of clusters
- find relationships between clusters
- track changes of clusters over time(e.g. merge, split, grow, shrink)
- cluster's evolution analysis(e.g. cluster lifespan, stability with fft or other methods)

6. visualize results
- plot clusters in 2D or 3D space
- plot time series data of clusters
- create interactive visualizations if needed
